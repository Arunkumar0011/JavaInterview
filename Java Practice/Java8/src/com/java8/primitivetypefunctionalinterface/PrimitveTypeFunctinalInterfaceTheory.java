	 * Normal functional interface like predicate, function, consumer and supplier
	 * always get inputs wrapper class objects
	 * 
	 * Bifuncational interface also getting inputs wrapper class objects
	 * 
	 * In this case internall Autoboxing and Autounboxing it will going to happen.
	 * It will cause the performance issue of the application
	 * 
	 * So only primitve type funcationla interfaces came to the picture
	 * 
	 * It will help ful for the performance inpact it will get the inputs as a
	 * primitive data types
